# Treasurer Data Analysis

## Data Source

The treasurer data used was primarily gotten from [The Political Graveyard](http://politicalgraveyard.com/). This website provided historical data on state treasurers across various states. To find specific treasurer data, you can look at "[(state) state treasurers politicalgraveyard.com](http://politicalgraveyard.com/)".

Additionally, more detailed and structured data can be accessed through this [Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1khn5-ga7sHQIj6xsysl5fMGg597mzmWPiw9MMnYssAQ/edit).

## Coding Process

The table is an overview of the public debt for the states. It was obtained using Python and the Pandas library to filter and process data from all sources, including The Political Graveyard. The individual entries for state treasurers and, in this case, their state debts were summed together to get the total public debts for each state, which were then put together in a table.
