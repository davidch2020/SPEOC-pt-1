# Transforming Post-1790 CD Debt Data

**Author:** Chris Liao (\[first name\] \[last name] (at) [uchicago] [dot] [edu])

## Objective

Turn raw post-1790 continental debt (CD) security data into an organized table indexed by individuals.


## Process

### 1. Adding Each Individual's Geography 

**Code**: 

- [clean_1_geo.ipynb](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/clean_1_geo.ipynb) combines the raw CD debt data from all states into one dataset and processes the given geography colum

**Inputs**:

- Raw Data

  1. [Post-1790 Continental Debt Files](data_raw/pre1790): csv files with suffix CD
  2. Examples
     1. Connecticut: [CT_post1790_CD_ledger.xlsx](data_raw/post1790/CT_post1790_CD_ledger.xlsx) 
     2. Georgia: [T694_GA_Loan_Office_CD.xlsx](data_raw/post1790/GA/T694_GA_Loan_Office_CD.xlsx)
-  [cd_raw.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/cd_raw.csv): arguments for importing state CD files
- [zip_code_database.xls](data_raw/census_data/zip_code_database.xls): geograhical database matching towns to counties
  - Downloaded from https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/zip_code_database.xls?download_auth=7b5b7133a55eef6807fc6da56f62bf27 
- [town_fix.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/town_fix.csv): database of changes to the gegographical classification

**Outputs (for future use)**: 

- [aggregated_CD_post1790.csv](data_clean/aggregated_CD_post1790.csv): continental debt files with final geographical classification

**Outputs (to check validity of cleaning process)**: 

- [change_df_CD](data_clean/check/town_occ_agg_check.csv): crosswalk mapping aggregation of multiple towns/occupations (raw data) to one town/occupation ([aggregated_CD_post1790.csv](data_clean/aggregated_CD_post1790.csv))

**Steps**:  

1. Using the arguments in [cd_raw.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/cd_raw.csv), the raw CD data for each state is imported and aggregated into one table
2. Our raw data (except for NY) contains a town and state column denoting the place of residence for each debtholder
   1. When an entry for the state column is missing, we impute the state loan office that the debtholder redeemed debt from
   2. When there are multiple town or occupation values for one debtholder entry, we select the value with longest string length (since it likely contains the most information). The results of this selection are in [change_df_CD](data_clean/check/town_occ_agg_check.csv). 
   3. When one debtholder entry has multiple names, we group them and note that the entry has multiple names. CT_10 has the value `Joseph Woodruff | Joseph Woodruffe` 
3. The town column in our raw data is extremely messy. Here are some of its problems
   1. The same location can be spelled multiple ways
      1. GA_24 and GA_33 have the values `Charleston South Carolina` and `Charleston` in their respective town column values
   2. The listed "town" might be a town, state or column
      1. PA_115 and PA_655 have the values `Cumberland` and `Cumb County Pennsylvania` in their respective town column values
4. Using fuzzy string matching with [zip_code_database.xls](data_raw/census_data/zip_code_database.xls), we identify whether a "town" value is a town, county or state, and reformat it
   1. For towns, we also find the corresponding county name
5. There are cases where we cannot use fuzzy string matching to clean our geographies (or less commonly, [zip_code_database.xls](data_raw/census_data/zip_code_database.xls) makes a mistake). In this case, we use [town_fix.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/town_fix.csv) to make the required changes
6. Our final results are in [aggregated_CD_post1790.csv](data_clean/aggregated_CD_post1790.csv) 

`town`, `occupation` and `state`  are given columns from the raw data but post step 2

`new_town`, `new_county`, `new_state`, `country`, `name_type ` are columns created post-cleaning and represent the location of an individual

|      | town                      | state | occupation | new_town      | county          | new_state | country | name_type |
| ---: | :------------------------ | :---- | :--------- | :------------ | :-------------- | :-------- | :------ | :-------- |
|    0 | Hartford                  | CT    | Merchant   | Hartford      | Hartford County | CT        | US      | town      |
|    2 | Rhode Island              | RI    | Farmer     | nan           | nan             | RI        | US      | state     |
|  390 | City of New York          | NY    | Merchant   | New York City | New York County | NY        | US      | town      |
| 2001 | Bucks County Pennsylvania | PA    | nan        | nan           | Bucks County    | PA        | US      | county    |

```python
# generate above - run at end of notebook
print(CD_all[['town', 'state', 'occupation', 'new_town', 'county', 'new_state', 'country', 'name_type']].loc[[0,2,390, 2001]].to_markdown())
```

### 2. Cleaning Names 

**Code**: 

- [clean_2_names.ipynb](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/clean_2_names.ipynb) cleans all the names in the CD debt file

**Inputs**:

- [aggregated_CD_post1790.csv](data_clean/aggregated_CD_post1790.csv): continental debt files with final geographical classification
- [company_names_fix.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/company_names_fix.csv): database of name changes for data cleaning purposes

**Outputs (for future use)**: 

- [aggregated_CD_post1790_names.csv](data_clean/aggregated_CD_post1790_names.csv): [aggregated_CD_post1790.csv](data_clean/aggregated_CD_post1790.csv) with cleaned names
- [name_list.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/name_list.csv): List of all identities in our raw debt data with cleaned names and geographies
  1. Identities have not been aggregated (two slightly mispelled names representing the same identity are denoted as separate identities)

**Outputs (for future research)**

- [company_research.csv](data_clean/check/company_research.csv): list of companies we want to map to owners/identities 

**Steps**:  

1. First, we import [aggregated_CD_post1790.csv](data_clean/aggregated_CD_post1790.csv) 
2. The names in [aggregated_CD_post1790.csv](data_clean/aggregated_CD_post1790.csv) can be quite messy for various reasons
   1. One "name" value can be multiple names: CT_19 has the value `John and James Davenport` 
   2. One "name" value can have extraneous information: RI_318 has the value `John Parker as Gaurdian`
   3. One "name" value can be an institution, not a name: RI_597 has the value `Clark and Nightingale Transferred from Register | Clark and Nightingale transferred` . `Clark and Nightingale` is a company owned by Joseph Innes Clark and Joseph Nightingale. In this case, we can match a company to the owner but we may not always be able to do this
      1. [company_research.csv](data_clean/check/company_research.csv) contains the list of companies we want to find identities for
   4. One debtholder entry can contain multiple names: CT_10 has the value `Joseph Woodruff | Joseph Woodruffe` . Different names are separated by ` | `
3. In section **Known Cleaning Process**, we clean names where we know how to fix the structure
4. In section **Import Name Fixes**, we clean names that have to be manually fixed (looked at each messed up entry one by one, then added the fixed name to the spreadsheet) using [company_names_fix.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/company_names_fix.csv)
   1. This process was tedious, even with GitHub copilot. we hope that this summer we can automate at least parts of this process 
5. In section **Manual Name Fixes**, we make some final name changes
6. Finally, we create a dataset of all unique identities (name + geography combinations) to feed to our scraper, outputted as [name_list.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/name_list.csv)
   1. Name values that are not actually names (and for who we cannot match to a set of actual names) are excludede from this dataset
   2. NH_22's name is `The Trustees of Phillips Academy` 
   3. GA_64's name is `Jackson and Nightingale` 
7. we also create [aggregated_CD_post1790_names.csv](data_clean/aggregated_CD_post1790_names.csv), which contains debt data, the original name and the new (cleaned) name

Here are some examples of the original name and the cleaned name

|      | original                                                     | new                                                          |
| ---: | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|    0 | Clark and Nightingale                                        | Joseph Innes Clark \| Joseph Nightingale                     |
|    1 | Jon and Jacob Starr \| Jonathan and Jared Starr              | Jacob Starr \| Jonathan Starr \| Jared Starr                 |
|   38 | Nicholas And Hannah Cooke \| Nicholas And Hannah Coske \| Robert Crooke | Hannah Cooke \| Hannah Coske \| Nicholas Cooke \| Nicholas Coske \| Robert Crooke |

```python
# generate code
print(df_comp.loc[[0,1,38]].to_markdown())
```

### 3. Scraping Census Data	

**Code**: 

- [clean_3_scrape.ipynb](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/clean_3_scrape.ipynb) cleans all the names in the CD debt file

**Inputs**:

- [name_list.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/name_list.csv): List of all identities in our raw debt data with cleaned names and geographies

**Outputs (for future use)**: 

- [name_list_scraped.csv](cleaning_CD/scrape_tools/name_list_scraped.csv): List of scrapable names in our dataset, with scraping results
- [scrape_ids.csv](cleaning_CD/scrape_tools/scrape_ids.csv): cleaned preliminary dataset of identities from Ancestry.com census scraper
- [scrape_results.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/scrape_results.csv): cleaned preliminary demographic data for identities from scraper

**Outputs (preliminary - not relevant outside of serving as checkpoints)**

- [scrape_ids_prelims.csv](cleaning_CD/scrape_tools/scrape_ids_prelim.csv): preliminary dataset of identities from scraper
- [scrape_results_prelim.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/scrape_results_prelim.csv): preliminary demographic data for identities from scraper

**Steps**:  

1. First, we import [name_list.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/name_list.csv)
2. The code for the scraper looks complicated, but here's the gist of how it works - describes the **Helper Functions** and **Run Scraper** sections
   1. Navigate to the ancestry.com library landing page and login to my UChicago student portal 
   2. Go to the 1790 census collection search page
   3. Loop through my list of individuals, enter the corresponding first name, last name and location, and search
      1. Each location has a special "location code" embedded in the search url - if we have not seen a location before, we find its location code and store it
      2. For each search, if we do not find a result, we reduce the strictness of the search (how exact the name match is, how exact the geography match is) up until we either **a)** find a result or **b)** reach my strictness threshold
   4. Store the results - the below files are saved after each search so no data is lost if the scraper crashes
      1. [scrape_ids_prelims.csv](cleaning_CD/scrape_tools/scrape_ids_prelim.csv) contains information on which matches on Ancestry.com an individual matched to and the number of matches (between 0-4)
      2. [scrape_results_prelim.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/scrape_results_prelim.csv) contains information on the demographic data for each Ancestry.com individual 
3. There are some manual changes we have to make to the results of our scraper and we do this in the **Clean Scraped Data** section
4. Finally, we reset the index of our dataframes by removing duplicate entries
   1. This turns out to be a bit more complicated than just using the `.reset_index()` command becuase our two datasets are relational
5. We export our final ancestry.com scraped data as [scrape_ids.csv](cleaning_CD/scrape_tools/scrape_ids.csv) and [scrape_results.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/scrape_results.csv)
6. We link our scraped census data to the names from the debt file in [name_list_scraped.csv](cleaning_CD/scrape_tools/name_list_scraped.csv)

**Example of scraped results matched to debtholder names**

|      | Fn_Fix   | Ln_Fix   | new_town   | county          | new_state | country | name_type | Match Index | Match Status              |
| ---: | :------- | :------- | :--------- | :-------------- | :-------- | :------ | :-------- | :---------- | :------------------------ |
|    1 | Benjamin | Trumbull | Bolton     | Tolland County  | CT        | US      | town      | 0           | Complete Match            |
|    9 | Joseph   | Woodruff | Farmington | Hartford County | CT        | US      | town      | 8\| 9       | 2 Potential Matches Found |
|   21 | Allen    | Olcott   | Farmington | Hartford County | CT        | US      | town      | nan         | No Match                  |

|      | Name                              | Home in 1790 (City, County, State) | Free White Persons - Males - 16 and over | Free White Persons - Females | Number of Household Members | Free White Persons - Males - Under 16 | Number of Slaves | Number of All Other Free Persons | Match Type |
| ---: | :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------: | ---------------------------: | --------------------------: | ------------------------------------: | ---------------: | -------------------------------: | :--------- |
|    0 | Benjn Trumbull \| Benja Trunabull | Bolton, Tolland, Connecticut       |                                        1 |                            1 |                           2 |                                   nan |              nan |                              nan | town       |
|    8 | Joseph Woodruff                   | Farmington, Hartford, Connecticut  |                                        2 |                            3 |                           6 |                                     1 |              nan |                              nan | town       |
|    9 | Joseph Woodruff                   | Farmington, Hartford, Connecticut  |                                        2 |                            4 |                          11 |                                     5 |              nan |                              nan | town       |

```python
# generate code for first and second tables
print(pd.read_csv('scrape_tools/name_list_scraped.csv', index_col = 0).loc[[1, 9, 21]][['Fn_Fix', 'Ln_Fix', 'new_town', 'county', 'new_state', 'country','name_type', 'Match Index', 'Match Status']].to_markdown())
print(pd.read_csv('scrape_tools/scrape_results.csv', index_col = 0).loc[[0, 8, 9]][['Name', 'Home in 1790 (City, County, State)','Free White Persons - Males - 16 and over','Free White Persons - Females', 'Number of Household Members','Free White Persons - Males - Under 16','Number of Slaves','Number of All Other Free Persons','Match Type']].to_markdown())
```

### 4. Creating Final Dataset	

**Code**: 

- [clean_4_final.ipynb](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/clean_4_final.ipynb) creates our final dataset

**Inputs**:

- [aggregated_CD_post1790.csv](data_clean/aggregated_CD_post1790.csv): continental debt files with final geographical classification
- [name_list_scraped.csv](cleaning_CD/scrape_tools/name_list_scraped.csv): List of scrapable names in our dataset, with scraping results
- [scrape_results.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/scrape_results.csv): cleaned preliminary dataset of data for matched identities from Ancestry.com census scraper 
- [name_list.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/name_list.csv): List of all identities in our raw debt data with cleaned names and geographies
  1. Identities have not been aggregated (two slightly mispelled names representing the same identity are denoted as separate identities)
- [name_agg.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/name_agg.csv): database of names spelled differently that correspond to the same identity
- [group_name_state.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/group_name_state.csv): database of names with locations in multiple states that correspond to the same identity
- [occ_correction.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/occ_correction.csv): database of occupation name changes for data cleaning purposes

**Outputs (for future use)**: 

- [final_data_CD.csv](data_clean/final_data_CD.csv): final table, indexed by individual, of aggregate CD debt holdings
- [match_data_CD.csv](data_clean/match_data.csv): database of ancestry.com data for final_data_CD



**Steps**:  

1. First, we import [aggregated_CD_post1790.csv](data_clean/aggregated_CD_post1790.csv), [name_list_scraped.csv](cleaning_CD/scrape_tools/name_list_scraped.csv), [scrape_results.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/scrape_results.csv) and [name_list.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/name_list.csv)

2. In **Adding Missing Occupations**, there are cases where an occupation is part of a name in [aggregated_CD_post1790.csv](data_clean/aggregated_CD_post1790.csv), but the occupation is not listed in the occupation column. we amend this by adding the occupation

   1. Example: In CT_333, there is no occupation listed even though the debtholder's name is `Wheeler Coit Treasurer and Co` , so we added the `treasurer` occupation to the occupation column

3. There are two steps in **Merge Data** to create the aggregate dataset we will work with

   1. In [aggregated_CD_post1790.csv](data_clean/aggregated_CD_post1790.csv) (variable `CD_clean`), one debtholder entry name (`Name` column) sometimes corresponds to multiple names. we merge it with [name_list.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/name_list.csv) (variable `name_df`), which maps one debtholder entry name (`Name`) to however many actual names are there are (values listed in `Name_Fix`). Note that now, the same debtholder entry may be linked to multiple "names". Here is an example:

      1. `CD_clean`

      2. |      | Name                                 | state_data | state_data_index | new_town   | county           | new_state | country | name_type |
         | ---: | :----------------------------------- | :--------- | ---------------: | :--------- | :--------------- | :-------- | :------ | :-------- |
         |    8 | Francis Brown                        | CT         |                9 | New Haven  | New Haven County | CT        | US      | town      |
         |    9 | Joseph Woodruff \|  Joseph Woodruffe | CT         |               10 | Farmington | Hartford County  | CT        | US      | town      |

         `name_df`

      3. |      | Name                                | Fn_Fix  | Ln_Fix    | county           | new_state | country | name_type |
         | ---: | :---------------------------------- | :------ | :-------- | :--------------- | :-------- | :------ | :-------- |
         |    8 | Francis Brown                       | Francis | Brown     | New Haven County | CT        | US      | town      |
         |    9 | Joseph Woodruff \| Joseph Woodruffe | Joseph  | Woodruff  | Hartford County  | CT        | US      | town      |
         |    9 | Joseph Woodruff \| Joseph Woodruffe | Joseph  | Woodruffe | Hartford County  | CT        | US      | town      |

         merged table (variable  `CD_merged`)

         |      | Name                                | state_data | state_data_index | Name_Fix                            | Fn_Fix  | Ln_Fix    | county           | new_state | country | name_type |
         | ---: | :---------------------------------- | :--------- | ---------------: | :---------------------------------- | :------ | :-------- | :--------------- | :-------- | :------ | :-------- |
         |    8 | Francis Brown                       | CT         |                9 | Francis Brown                       | Francis | Brown     | New Haven County | CT        | US      | town      |
         |    9 | Joseph Woodruff \| Joseph Woodruffe | CT         |               10 | Joseph Woodruff \| Joseph Woodruffe | Joseph  | Woodruff  | Hartford County  | CT        | US      | town      |
         |   10 | Joseph Woodruff \| Joseph Woodruffe | CT         |               10 | Joseph Woodruff \| Joseph Woodruffe | Joseph  | Woodruffe | Hartford County  | CT        | US      | town      |

      4. Code: 

         ```python
         # generate code for all tables
         print(CD_clean.loc[[8, 9]][['Name', 'state_data', 'state_data_index', 'new_town', 'county', 'new_state', 'country', 'name_type',]].to_markdown())
         print(name_df.loc[[8, 9]][['Name', 'Fn_Fix', 'Ln_Fix', 'county', 'new_state', 'country', 'name_type',]].to_markdown())
         print(CD_merged.loc[[8,9,10]][['Name', 'state_data', 'state_data_index', 'Name_Fix', 'Fn_Fix', 'Ln_Fix', 'county', 'new_state', 'country', 'name_type',]].to_markdown())
         ```

   2. Next, we merge our merged table with `name_list_scraped.csv` (variable `scraped_names`) so that our table includes information on the census match results from Ancestry.com. Here is an example

      1. `CD_merged` 

         |      | Name          | state_data | state_data_index | Name_Fix      | Fn_Fix  | Ln_Fix | county           | new_state | country | name_type |
         | ---: | :------------ | :--------- | ---------------: | :------------ | :------ | :----- | :--------------- | :-------- | :------ | :-------- |
         |    8 | Francis Brown | CT         |                9 | Francis Brown | Francis | Brown  | New Haven County | CT        | US      | town      |

      2. `scraped_names`

         |      | Fn_Fix  | Ln_Fix | county           | new_state | country | name_type | Match Index | Match Status   |
         | ---: | :------ | :----- | :--------------- | :-------- | :------ | :-------- | ----------: | :------------- |
         |    8 | Francis | Brown  | New Haven County | CT        | US      | town      |           7 | Complete Match |

      3. merged table (variable `CD_merged_mind`)

      5. Code: 

         ```python
         # generate code for all tables
         print(CD_merged.loc[[8]][['Name', 'state_data', 'state_data_index', 'Name_Fix', 'Fn_Fix', 'Ln_Fix', 'county', 'new_state', 'country', 'name_type',]].to_markdown())
         print(scraped_names.loc[[8]][['Fn_Fix', 'Ln_Fix','county', 'new_state', 'country', 'name_type','Match Index', 'Match Status']].to_markdown())
         print(CD_merged_mind.loc[[8]][['Name', 'state_data', 'state_data_index', 'Name_Fix', 'Fn_Fix', 'Ln_Fix', 'Full Search Name', 'county', 'new_state', 'country', 'name_type','Match Index', 'Match Status']].to_markdown())
         ```

4. Next, we begin the process of grouping names that represent the same identity together in the **Group Names - Using Ancestry.com Matches** section. First, we take advantage of the fact that sometimes, Ancestry.com matches two individuals with slightly different names to the same identity (variable `Match Index`)

   1. We pick the name that is longest (measured by string length) to be the "representative name" for the identity

   2. There are some manual corrections we have to make, when we don't want to the longest name to be the representative name

      1. We create new columns with the prefix `Group` to describe characteristics (town, county, state, name) for the identity
      2. This is important because sometimes, multiple names have different values for the aforementioned characteristics (for example, one name might have location at `name_type` county, while another has location at `name_type` town  - see tables below)
      3. We pick values for whatever characteristic is most detailed (in the above example, we pick `name_type` town)
      4. Sometimes the "representative name" also has different characteristics and in these cases, we apply the same procedure and set the characteristics to be the most specific

   3. Here's an example for a case where we don't have to change the location (`Richard Woottan`) and a case where we do (`Gassaway Watkins`)

      1. |      | Name                                                   | state_data | state_data_index | Name_Fix                                               | Fn_Fix   | Ln_Fix  | county              | new_state | country | name_type | Match Index | Match Status   | Group Name       | Group Town | Group County        | Group State | Group Country | Group Name Type | Group Match Index | Group Match Status |

         # code
         print(CD_merged_mind[CD_merged_mind['Group Name'].apply(lambda x: x in ['Richard Woottan', 'Gassaway Watkins'])][['Name', 'state_data', 'state_data_index', 'Name_Fix', 'Fn_Fix', 'Ln_Fix', 'county', 'new_state', 'country', 'name_type','Match Index', 'Match Status','Group Name', 'Group Town', 'Group County', 'Group State', 'Group Country', 'Group Name Type','Group Match Index', 'Group Match Status',]].to_markdown())
         ```

5. Next, we have a list of names (manually curated)  that represent the same identity but are slightly misspelled that we deal with in the **Group Names - Fuzzy Matching**. These are names that the Ancestry.com APwe could not find matches for, or somehow missed. we import [name_agg.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/name_agg.csv) (variable `rep_names`)

   1. Sometimes, a `location` value is needed to identify which individual we are referring to - as there can be multiple individuals with the same name. 

   2. Note that we don't need to go through the same process as earlier of filtering different `name_type` values to figure out what location level we want because the `new` name column was manually curated. An algorithm that generates would have to consider this when deciding what name is going to be in the `original` column (which name is being replaced) and what name is going to be in the `new` (the replacement name).

      1. The manual curation process used techniques described in the **Name Matching Algorithms** section of the [2023 Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U8bUp_No2pjpLYHOAKkroEMwqUkKn6Adz47YhAIbauE/edit#)

   3. Here's an example of two entries in `rep_names` and the subsequent result. Notice how John Salter represents the identities of multiple individuals, so we specify a location

      1. `rep_names` 

         |      | original      | new           | location                                        |

         |   12 | John Saller   | John Salter   | Mansfield Center \| Tollan County \| CT \| town |

         # code
         print(rep_names[rep_names['new'].apply(lambda x: x == 'Hannah Howley' or x == 'John Salter')].to_markdown())
         print(CD_merged_mind[CD_merged_mind['Group Name'].apply(lambda x: x == 'Hannah Howley' or x == 'John Salter')][['Name', 'state_data', 'state_data_index', 'Name_Fix', 'Fn_Fix', 'Ln_Fix', 'county', 'new_state', 'country', 'name_type','Match Index', 'Match Status','Group Name', 'Group Town', 'Group County', 'Group State', 'Group Country', 'Group Name Type','Group Match Index', 'Group Match Status',]].to_markdown())
         ```

6. Another group of people we want to group together are those that have the same name, but different places of residence, which we handle in **Group Names - same name, within state**.These are individuals who have the same name and reside in the same state, but have different locations. 

   1. In particular, these names, collectively, must have

      1. One unique `town` name and one unique `county` name (excluding cases where no town or county name is listed)
      2. At least one `name_type` (county + town, county + state, or town + state)
      3. No more than 2 different `county` names

   2. These ensure that we don't have individuals with contradicting information (for example, Bob Rob in Anne Arundel County, MD and Baltimore County MD) who clearly correspond to different identities

   3. Note that many of these individuals have overlapping or the same Ancestry.com match data. However, they were not covered in **Group Names - Using Ancestry.com Matches** because a) their names are the same and b) they might only have overlapping, as opposed to the same Ancestry.com match data

   4. Here's an example. Note that `Abner Johnson` has overlapping, as opposed to identical Ancestry.com match data because in the case where we have town information, we can identify his census record more precisely

7. In **Create Group Columns and Group Data**, we group our individuals by identity (name + location + match data)

   1. Column explanations

      1. the `Name_Fix` column contains all "fixed names" associated with an individual
      2. the `Full Search Name` column contains all names used to search for this person on Ancestry.com, separated by `|`
      3. the `assets` column contains all of the assets asociated with this individual. Different debt entries are separated by `|` , each debt entry separates the index and assets by ` : `, and 6%/6% deferred/3% stocks are separated by ","
      4. the `occupation` column contains all of the assets asociated with this individual, separated by `|`

   2. |      | Group Name        | Group State | Group County     | Group Town   | Group Name Type | Group Match Index | Name_Fix                                | Full Search Name                       | assets                     | occupation |
      | ---: | :---------------- | :---------- | :--------------- | :----------- | :-------------- | :---------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- | :------------------------- | :--------- |
      |    4 | Aaron Caldwell II | CT          | Hartford County  | Hartford     | town            |                   | ['Aaron Cadwell Ii, Aaron Caldwell Ii'] | Aaron Cadwell Iwe \| Aaron Caldwell Ii | CT_98 : 9.25, 4.63, 0.0    |            |
      |    8 | Aaron Kelsey      | CT          | Middlesex County | Killingworth | town            | 423 \| 424        | ['Aaron Kelsey']                        | Aaron Kelsey                           | CT_445 : 63.4, 31.7, 75.62 | Farmer     |

   3. ```python
      # code
      print(df_final.loc[[4,8]].drop('Group Match Url', axis = 1).to_markdown())
      ```

8. In **Impute Location - Corporations**, we use a clever trick to obtain more location information for people in our dataset

   1. In the example below, we see that Alexander Mowatt has his own entry in our final table, but holds assets as part of two partnerships: `Alexander Mowatt | John Mowatt, Alexander Mowatt | Michael Mowatt `. We can assume they are business partners (they're likely also related, although that's not relevant for our case)

   2. Moreover, we see that John Mowatt has the location `New York City | New York County | NY` while Alexander Mowatt only has the location `NY`. Our underlying assumption is that Alexander Mowatt is likely also located in NYC, so we impute his location with John Mowatt's location

   3. Here is how we identify these cases:

      1. We look at what partnerships an individual has within their state of residence (who else lives in NY and has a  `Name_Fix` column with Alexander Mowatt's name)

      2. If the number of unique counties and names is greater than one (including the absence of a county as a unique value), then there is an opportunity to impute a more specific location

         1. Once again, we can only perform this process if we don't have contradicting information - so we cannot impute locations if two people live in different counties, or if they live in the same county but different towns

         2. We refer to these as "contradicting cases"

      3. We run a loop to do this multiple times until we only have "contradicting cases" left. Note that we cannot do this just once, we have to use a loop. Here's an example why.

         1. Suppose John and Robert are part of a partnership, and they both live in CT. In our first iteration, Robert, who is also in a partnership with William, is imputed with location New Haven, New Haven County, CT because William has that location. Now, it is likely that John, by virtue of being Robert's partner, is likely a resident of New Haven, New Haven County, CT. However, in the first round, John's location was not imputed but now, in the second round of the loop, his location will be imputed.
         2. If you want to see an example of this behavior, check out `Abram Belknap`. 
         3. **Something to think about**: Do we also want to impute **occupation?** If John is a merchant, do we think Robert is also a merchant?

      4. Example

         1. Example (before)

            |      | Group Name     | Group State | Group County    | Group Town | Group Name Type | Group Match Index | Name_Fix                                         | Full Search Name | assets                                                       | occupation                         |

            |  133 | Amasa Keyes    | CT          | Hartford County | Hartford   | town            |               760 | ['Amasa Keyes \| Elnathan Keyes', 'Amasa Keyes'] | Amasa Keyes      | CT_894 : 16.62, 8.31, 11.95 \| CT_927 : 266.67, 0.0, 192.0 \| CT_932 : 145.84, 72.92, 164.86 | Executor to Stephen Keyes Deceased |

         2. Example (after) 

         3. |      | Group Name     | Group State | Group County    | Group Town | Group Name Type | Group Match Index | Name_Fix                                         | Full Search Name | assets                                                       | occupation                         |
            | ---: | :------------- | :---------- | :-------------- | :--------- | :-------------- | ----------------: | :----------------------------------------------- | :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
            |  133 | Amasa Keyes    | CT          | Hartford County | Hartford   | town            |               760 | ['Amasa Keyes \| Elnathan Keyes', 'Amasa Keyes'] | Amasa Keyes      | CT_894 : 16.62, 8.31, 11.95 \| CT_927 : 266.67, 0.0, 192.0 \| CT_932 : 145.84, 72.92, 164.86 | Executor to Stephen Keyes Deceased |

            Code has to be run before and after our process - see notebook for specific example of implementation

            ```python
            # code 
            print(df_final[df_final['Name_Fix'].apply(lambda x: any(['Elnathan Keyes' in ele for ele in x]))].drop('Group Match Url', axis = 1).to_markdown())
            ```

9. Now, in the section **Cleaning Name_Fix**, we unify name spellings. Consider the example below. Notice how in the `Name_Fix` column, we have very similar names that correspond to the same identity (`Ebenezar Denny` and `Ebenezer Denny`). We want to unify these so that one identity is represented by one name (in particular, the name used for `Group Name`). From this, we can tell that Ebenezer Denny owned debt on his own, and with Edward Denny. 

   1. Original output

      |      | Group Name     | Group State | Group County | Group Town | Group Name Type | Group Match Index | Name_Fix                                                     | Full Search Name                 | assets                                                       | occupation |
      | :--- | :------------- | :---------- | :----------- | :--------- | :-------------- | :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
      | 738  | Ebenezer Denny | PA          |              |            | state           |                   | ['Ebenezar Denny', 'Ebenezar Denny \| Ebenezer Denny \| Edward Denny'] | Ebenezar Denny \| Ebenezer Denny | PA_185 : 1330.73, 665.37, 449.96 \|  PA_219 : 0.0, 0.0, 1000.0 |            |

   2. In our result, (second table, the one below), we see in the column `Name_Fix_Clean` that Ebenezer Denny belongs to two groups of debtholders: himself (Ebenezer Denny) and with Edward (Ebenezer Denny | Edward Denny). Groups are separated by `:` and individuals within a group are separated by `|`

   3. Moreover, in `Name_Fix_Transfer`, we have a mapping between the original `Name_Fix` value and the corresponding value in `Name_Fix_Clean`. Different mappings are separated by `:` and within a mapping, we have the format `value / key`. For example, `Ebenezer Denny  / Ebenezar Denny` shows that the original name `Ebenezar Denny` is now represented as `Ebenezer Denny`. Moreover, the original name `Ebenezar Denny | Ebenezer Denny | Edward Denny`  is now represented as `Ebenezer Denny  | Edward Denny`, as shown by `Ebenezer Denny | Edward Denny  / Ebenezar Denny | Ebenezer Denny | Edward Denny`

   4. Output after cleaning

   5. |      | Group Name     | Group State | Group County | Group Town | Group Name Type | Group Match Index | Full Search Name                 | assets                                                       | occupation | Name_Fix_Transfer                                            | Name_Fix_Clean                                  |

      |  738 | Ebenezer Denny | PA          |              |            | state           |                   | Ebenezar Denny \| Ebenezer Denny | PA_185 : 1330.73, 665.37, 449.96 \| PA_219 : 0.0, 0.0, 1000.0 |            | Ebenezer Denny / Ebenezar Denny : Ebenezer Denny \| Edward Denny  / Ebenezar Denny \| Ebenezer Denny \| Edward Denny | Ebenezer Denny : Ebenezer Denny \| Edward Denny |

      

      ```python
      # code
      print(df_final[df_final['Group Name'] == 'Ebenezer Denny'].drop('Group Match Url', axis = 1).to_markdown())
      ```

10. Next, in **Manual Adjustments**, for some odd reason ,we have a few cases where the same identity appears twice. We fix these by combining those data points. 

   1. we do this manually, but it would be nice to code up a function that does it automatically

11. Another group of people we want to group together are those that have the same name, but different places of residence, which we handle in **Group Names - incorrect states** This occurs because when we impute values for the `state` column, sometimes the incorrect value is imputed (example: CT debt file, individual from MA but missing `state` column value but we impute CT as the state). In our example, we know this is an incorrect value because another individual from `MA` has the same name, an ancestry.com match, and (often times) also holds CT debt in the same file. 

    1. In this case, we set the group characteristics to be whatever data is most specific (most specific `name_type` for location)

    2. The variable `state_group_names` contains our list of potential duplicates, imported from [group_name_state.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/group_name_state.csv)

    3. To identify these cases, we find all names that appear across multiple states, then make sure that there are strictless less counties than states (removing cases where counties don't exist). This ensures that there is at least one pair of name + state that does not contradict each other (if we have 2 different states + 2 different counies, the state value column was not imputed which tells us that those 2 names represent different identities)

       1. Then, we go through the list manually and using techniques from the **Name Matching Algorithms** section of the  [2023 Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U8bUp_No2pjpLYHOAKkroEMwqUkKn6Adz47YhAIbauE/edit#) (and examining whether the two individuals in question both own debt from the same state debt file, of which affirmation is a positive sign)

    4. When both names only have location `name_type` at the state value, we input manually which state to aggregate data at (based on manual inspection)

       1. Otherwise, we pick the most specific `name_type`, as per our usual procedure. See example below

    5. Before

       |      | Group Name     | Group State | Group County      | Group Town | Group Name Type | Group Match Index |
       | ---: | :------------- | :---------- | :---------------- | :--------- | :-------------- | :---------------- |
       |   79 | Adam Gilchrist | NY          |                   |            | state           |                   |
       |   80 | Adam Gilchrist | SC          | Charleston County | Charleston | town            | 858               |

       

    6. After

       |      | Group Name     | Group State | Group County      | Group Town | Group Name Type | Group Match Index |
       | ---: | :------------- | :---------- | :---------------- | :--------- | :-------------- | ----------------: |
       |   79 | Adam Gilchrist | SC          | Charleston County | Charleston | town            |               858 |

    7. ```python
       # code
       print(df_final[df_final['Group Name'] == 'Adam Gilchrist'][['Group Name', 'Group State', 'Group County', 'Group Town', 'Group Name Type', 'Group Match Index']].to_markdown())
       ```

12. Next, we move onto cleaning the dataset that contains Ancestry.com demographic data in section **Add Villages**. We import the dataset [scrape_results.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/scrape_results.csv) (variable `match_df`)

    1. The Ancestry.com Census data does not list a geography that can be classified as a town for most Philadelphia/Charleston/New York City residents; instead, it lists a subdivision of the city, such as `New York City East Ward`

    2. I create a separate category called `Match Village` for the relevant census data, and replace the `Match Town` column value with the corresponding city (Philadelphia, Charleston, New York City)

    3. Example of an entry that is a village

       |      | Name        | Home in 1790 (City, County, State)          | Free White Persons - Males - 16 and over | Free White Persons - Females | Number of Household Members | Free White Persons - Males - Under 16 | Number of Slaves | Number of All Other Free Persons | Match Type | Match Town    | Match County    | Match State | index_temp | index_new | Match Village           |
       | ---: | :---------- | :------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------: | ---------------------------: | --------------------------: | ------------------------------------: | :--------------- | :------------------------------- | :--------- | :------------ | :-------------- | :---------- | ---------: | --------: | :---------------------- |
       |  613 | Thomas Vail | New York City East Ward, New York, New York |                                        1 |                            4 |                           7 |                                     2 |                  |                                  | village    | New York City | New York County | New York    |        648 |       613 | New York City East Ward |

    4. ```python
       print(match_df[match_df['Name'] == 'Thomas Vail'].to_markdown())
       ```

13. For some individuals in `match_df`, their `Name` column also includes an occupation. In the section **Get Occupations from Ancestry** I extract these occupations from the `Name` column. Most of these names are recognizable by the fact that they have a comma (`,`) or parentheses (`(` or `)`) which contains the occupation in question. You can also identify all possible instances where an occupation is in a name (and unfortunately ome false positives) if you filter for names that are over 3 words (at least 2 words for a name + occupation)

    1. Cleaning this was really tedious as we had to inspect the variety of situations above. However, it does yield us occupations for **400** individuals from `match_df`

    2. Before example

    4. Quite annoying... 

       ```python
       # before and after code
       print(match_df[match_df['Name'] == 'Comfort (Wd) Clock | Wd Combert Clock'].to_markdown())
       print(match_df.loc[[145]].to_markdown())
       ```

14. Sometimes, our scraping algorithm assigns multiple matches to an individual because it is unsure about which census record matches our specified individual. However, due to both a) idiosyncracies with the scraping algorithm and b) idiosyncracies with Ancestry.com, sometimes (not often) we will have an individual who matches to multiple individuals, but has a direct name match with one of them. We resolve this in **Improve Scraper Match** by removing matches when we have a case where

    1. one identity matches to multiple census records
    2. one of those multiple census records is a direct name match with the associated identity

15. In **Eliminate Broad Location Matches**, we consider cases where an identity is matched to multiple Ancestry.com census records. Now that we have improved location data from **Impute Location - Corporations**, we can retroactively improve the specificity of the potential census records. Sometimes, due to idosyncracies of the scraping algorithm, we also have cases where we have more matches than we should nad this process can remove those. 

    1. Here's an example of an improvement

       1. Original entry in main table

       2. Match Data - We can keep just 2862 in this case.

          ```python
          # code
          print(df_final.loc[[1775]].drop('Group Match Url', axis = 1).to_markdown())
          print(match_df.loc[[2862,2863,2864]].to_markdown())
          ```

    2. Here's an example of an idiosyncracy. Benjamin Gallup was originally matched to two records because originally we only had information on the county he lived in (note that Voluntown used to belong to Windham but now belongs to New London County). We can now filter to only include Match Index 638 because we know Benjamin Gallup resides in Voluntown.

       1. Original entry in main table

          |      | Group Name      | Group State | Group County      | Group Town | Group Name Type | Group Match Index | Full Search Name | assets                       | occupation | Name_Fix_Transfer                 | Name_Fix_Clean  |
          | ---: | :-------------- | :---------- | :---------------- | :--------- | :-------------- | :---------------- | :--------------- | :--------------------------- | :--------- | :-------------------------------- | :-------------- |

       ```python
       # code
       print(df_final[df_final['Group Name'] == 'Benjamin Gallup'].drop('Group Match Url', axis = 1).to_markdown())
       print(match_df[match_df['Name'] == 'Benjn Gallop'].to_markdown())
       ```

16. Next, in **Use Census to Impute Location** we have the opportunity to use the amazing information the Ancestry.com census provides us with.

    1. If an individual only has one match, and the Ancestry.com census location is more specific (ie: provides town geography when our data only has county geography) then we add the Ancestry.com census location to our dataset
    2. If an individual has multiple matches, we find the most detailed level of information for which all of the Ancestry.com census matches are the same. Similarly to earlier, when this aggregated census location is more specific (ie: provides town geography when our data only has county geography) then we add the aggregated census location to our dataset
    3. In cases where we have a location conflict at the state level (census state differs from given state), except for when the state equals `NY`, we remove the match
       1. NY is a special case because no state column was in NY (all location values were imputed + at state level), so we exclude it

    4. In cases where we have a location conflict at the county level (census county differs from given county), or a location conflict at the town level, we mark what level of location conflict we have and **do not** merge the ancestry.com location into our location for our final dataset
    5. In cases where we do not have a location conflict, and the census data was added, we **do** merge the ancestry.com location into our location for our final dataset

17. In **Occupation Column Cleaning**, I clean the `occupation` column by unifying the name format using a mapping. We worked on this last year and explored using automated solutions, but there was still a large (too large) degree of manual input required so I just exported the manually craeted mapping as [occ_correction.csv](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/occ_correction.csv) and used that. 

    1. We should look into using NLP solutions, which we did not do last year, to automate this process. 

    2. Example of mapping table

    3. |      | Original             | Corrected |
       | ---: | :------------------- | :-------- |
       |    0 | Merchant             | Merchant  |
       |    7 | Trader               | Merchant  |
       |   12 | Merchants            | Merchant  |
       |   44 | Traders              | Merchant  |
       |   60 | Marchant             | Merchant  |
       |   65 | Charleston Merchants | Merchant  |
       |   99 | Traders In Company   | Merchant  |
       |  204 | Merchents            | Merchant  |
       |  274 | Mercht               | Merchant  |

       ```python
       # code
       print(occ_data[occ_data['Corrected'].apply(lambda x: x in ['Merchant'])].head(9)[['Original', 'Corrected']].to_markdown())
       ```

18. In **Reset Match Data Index**, we reset the index of our match data by removing entries that are no longer in the data, and then reindexing everything so that our match values go from 1... number of match values. This turns out to be a bit more complicated than just using the `.reset_index()` command becuase our two datasets are relational, but the code is essentially the same as in [clean_3_scrape.ipynb](cleaning_CD/clean_tools/clean_3_scrape.ipynb) 

19. In **Aggregate Debt Totals**, we want to calculate an individual's total holdings of 6%, 6% deferred and 3% stock. We calculate two measures. The first measure is the sum of all of an individual's holdings. However, this measure does not take into account that multiple individuals can hold the same debt, so our second measure is the sum of an individual's holdings, where debt held by multiple people is divided into equal shares. For example, if Bob and George both hold \$200 worth of debt together, then their second measure would have value \$100

20. In **Final Data Export**, I export our final table (variable `df_final`) and the match table (variable `match_df`). For any individual, the `|` separated values in Group Match Index indicate their associated Ancestry.com census records, and correspond to the same value in the `index_new` column of `match_df`.

## Other Things

The following links to state population data ([statepop.csv](data_raw/census_data/statepop.csv): https://web.viu.ca/davies/H320/population.colonies.htm) and county population data ([countyPopulation.csv](data_raw/census_data/countyPopulation.csv): https://www.socialexplorer.com/tables/Census1790/R13347861) that may be helpful in understanding the proportion of individuals in a state who held debt. 

To make maps, we use shapefiles. We have shapefiles at the county and state level.
