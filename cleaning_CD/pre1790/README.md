# Cleaning Pre-1790 Debt Data 
The goal of this exercise was to clean the names of the individuals in the pre-1790 individual state debt files. There were many different kinds of issues we found with individuals' names. All of them can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pcSQfWNll6K9tl-_rB4lztN0TsZsclU9vOnbyQob-Zs/edit), along with comments and examples. In order to go about cleaning the individual debt files, ```@Snapwhiz914``` and ```@davidch2020``` decided to work on different parts of the cleaning process.
