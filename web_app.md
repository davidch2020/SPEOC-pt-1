This is (preliminary) documentation for a web app that was produced using https://dash.plotly.com. The goal of the web app is to 

1. show off the data and analysis we have 

2. allow other people to conduct their own analysis using the different data metrics we have obtained

Right now, we have

1. A title (My Dash App) that needs to be changed that sounds nicer/cooler
2. A navigation bar (Home, About, Contact) that in theory, takes you to other pages of the web app. In practice, it does not take you to those pages because those pages have not been created yet
3. A Project Desccription tab that allows you to move between different slides. This is very functional but we have not filled in the content of the project description
4. A panel that allows you to select between displaying either a map or table. Some preliminary things we want to work on are
   1. Actually displaying a map of our data, as opposed to a random map
   2. Allowing people to select options within the map or table option on the left panel to further customize the table or map





I made the app using ChatGPT for the most part. I essentially describe the feature that I want, and then in the same input box, provide ChatGPT with the `web_app.py` file contexts and `styles.css` contents so it can make the necessary changes
